description: 'This resource tells to explore the relationship between driven current
  and driving emf in three simple circuits that contain: (1) only resistance; (2)
  only inductance; and (3) only capacitance, to examine these same relationships in
  the general case where R, L, and C are all present, and to do two sample problems
  on the LRC circuits.'
